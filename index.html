        <h1>Understanding How Interactive Websites Work</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome! This page will help explain how CSS, JavaScript, and HTML all
          work together to make modern websites beautiful and interactive! As you read below and on other pages on this site, 
          you will see examples of how and why websites work the way they do. This is by no means an exhaustive look at 
          website interactivity, but it will give you a basic understanding to work with. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="html">HTML Basics</h2>
        <section class="intro-html">
          <p>When learning about website interactivity, the first thing you need to understand is HTML. Think of HTML as the foundation of a houseâ€”it provides the structure for a webpage. HTML is written using tags and elements, which are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;).</p>
      
          <p>For example, one commonly used tag is the paragraph tag, written as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Any text placed between these tags will be displayed as a paragraph on the webpage. Without wrapping the text in the opening and closing <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, the content wouldn't appear correctly.</p>
      
          <p>If a developer were to write <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;</code>, it will render as a paragraph, like this:</p>
         
          <section>

            <hr>
            <p>Hello World!</p>
            <hr>
          </section>

        <h2 id="css">CSS Basics</h2>
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used to style and layout HTML elements on the page. For example, CSS allows you to change the color of a text, add borders, and control spacing and positioning. Let's see an example:
        </p>
        <div class="css-example">
          <p>This is a text that will change color when hovered over.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="javascript">JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a scripting language that allows us to add interactivity to our websites. With JavaScript, you can create dynamic features like counters, animations, and event handling. Here's an interactive button example:
        </p>
        
        <button id="counterBtn" role="button" aria-label="Click to increase counter">
          Click me! (Counter: <span id="counter">0</span>)
        </button>

        <p>In the code below, we're using a simple function to count the number of times the button is clicked:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let counter = 0;
            document.getElementById('counterBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {
                counter++;
                document.getElementById('counter').textContent = counter;
            });
          </code>
        </pre>
      </main>
    </div>
